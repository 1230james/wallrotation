# WallRotation
An Android app to automatically swap out wallpapers in a set rotation of images at set intervals.

## Goals
* Change wallpapers at a set interval (daily, hourly, etc.)
* Assign wallpapers into groups/tags, then use those groups to manipulate wallpaper selection.
    * e.g. Select a wallpaper from group A, then select one from group B next time without picking one from group A again.

*This README will be more fleshed out as more progress is made.*
